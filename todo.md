# Attention throughout development
- keep in step with [Udacity Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/918/view)
- if use API, ensure search results match our state in both search and home pages
- be sure to **--save** any node tools the app uses
- declaratively map/filter/reduce over arrays (state)
