    - [X] subcomponents: book < shelf; shelf < app
    - [ ] subcomponents
    	- [X] book < search, so queried books have same look and selection
    	- [ ] book < shelf < list, if need to split up book listing further
    	- [ ] search input < search, if need to split out query input
    	- [ ] search results < search, if need to split results display from input 
- [X] decide what state and passed-in props look like
	- [X] include propTypes in components
	- [X] basic setup/questions about data store
	- [X] decide how to use state and props
	- [X] organize the static test data (based on API state)
- [X] fetch books from API to replace the static test data
	- [X] study and compare logged out fetched objects
	- [X] chain onto promise results to set App state
	- [X] store books array in App state to match API state
	- [X] update past/present/future labels to match API state

	- [ ] books with no .authors data correctly find and display author state (but can't get all from App!)
	- [X] ? have component in charge of store (App) do the updates instead of Search
	- [ ] search results do not show duplicates of Linux book (duped from first select option code)

# Attention throughout development
- keep in step with [Udacity Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/918/view)
- if use API, ensure search results match our state in both search and home pages
- be sure to **--save** any node tools the app uses
- declaratively map/filter/reduce over arrays (state)

# Beyond mvp
- "Above and Beyond" instructor lesson vid suggestions
	- [ ] CSS styles
