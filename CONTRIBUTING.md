# How to Contribute

This is a quick guide for users who would like to contribute to MyReads. Please take the time to discuss the change you wish to make with the project owner before you make that change. If you merely wish to build on top of the existing project, consider instead **fork**ing or **clone**ing it and following the instructions in README.md!

## Submitting a Pull Request

Before you submit a request, please follow this checklist:
* Update or remove any added install or build dependencies for the project. "Working locally" does not mean "working"!
* Leave a clear, readable commit history that follows the [Udacity Git Commit Message Style Guide](https://udacity.github.io/git-styleguide/).
* Update the README.md with any important info that follows from or motivated your changes.
* Update the TODO.md to reflect your tasks and wishlist, but be cautious about removing existing list items.
* Add a note about your contribution to the CONTRIBUTING.md [Contribution History](#contribution-history).
* Submit your Pull Request to the project owner.

## Academic Constraints

The files in this repository are built as a student project on top of Udacity's [MyReads starter templates](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter/). The project has a number of target requirements detailed in the [project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/918/view). The project is also expected to conform to the [Udacity style guide](http://udacity.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-styleguide/). Deviations from the rubric and the style guide will only be considered – with accompanying justification – after the project has been graded. Even then, requests containing either large departures or multiple departures from the rubric are less likely to be merged into the project.

Additionally, If your request alters any of the core files (the ones marked "not modified from Udacity project" in the README.md tree), then it likely will not be merged into the project.
